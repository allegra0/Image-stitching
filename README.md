# Image-stitching
A simple panorama stitcher using computer vision which is able to stitch together two images.

Ideal execution environment

For a more suitable panorama images must have an overlapping zone and have the same size. You may have to give images in a good order too.
Several improvements can still be made, such as the use of more than 2 images and the management of anomalies due to image size differences.
